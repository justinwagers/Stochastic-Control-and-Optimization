## Problem Overview

Not only do airlines have to decide their optimal pricing decisions, they also have to decide how many tickets to sell. Airlines have a trade-off between revenue sales of tickets versus their overbooking costs. In this report, we utilize dynamic programming to consider these two decisions: (1) coach and first class ticket pricing and (2) amount of coach tickets to overbook. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(textshape)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
usd <- dollar_format(prefix = "$")
```

```{r define_variables, include=FALSE}
## DEFINE ALL VARIABLES HERE

#define coach
priceL_coach = 300
priceH_coach = 350
pL_coach = c(0.35,0.65) # demand probabilities for low price
pH_coach = c(0.7,0.3) # demand probabilities for high price

# define first class
priceL_first = 425
priceH_first = 500
pL_first = c(0.92,0.08) # demand probabilities for low price
pH_first = c(0.96,0.04) # demand probabilities for high price

delta = 1/(1+0.15/365) # discount rate

M_coach=100 # number of seats in coach
M_first=20 # number of seats in first class

T_coach=105 # number of tickets sold in coach
T_first=20 # number of tickets sold in first class

T=365 # days until takeoff

# prob of showing up
p_show_coach = 0.95
p_show_first = 0.97

# overbooking cost
c_1 = 50
c_2 = 425

min_overbook = 5
max_overbook = 15
```


Assumptions and given information

* Revenue comes in from demand for tickets in the time before takeoff

* Overbooking cost is incurred on the day of takeoff 

* Overbooking is not allowed in first class

* If coach is overbooked and more ticket holders than seats show up, they can be first bumped to first class (if there are empty seats) at a cost of `r usd(c_1)` and second bumped off the plane at a cost of `r usd(c_2)`.

* Demand for coach and first class seats is independent


When selling in coach and first class, there are two possible pricing decisions, shown below. 

```{r eda, echo=FALSE}
# make table for pricing
pricing = cbind(usd(c(priceL_coach,priceH_coach)), usd(c(priceL_first,priceH_first)))
colnames(pricing) = c("Coach ","First Class ")
row.names(pricing) = c("Low Price ","High Price ")
kable(pricing, caption = "Pricing Decisions", align = 'c')
```


Given each pricing decision and class, the probability of purchase is shown below. 

```{r eda2, echo=FALSE}
# make table for purchase probability
prob_purchase = cbind(c(pL_coach[2],pH_coach[2]), c(pL_first[2],pH_first[2]))
colnames(prob_purchase) = c("Coach ","First Class ")
row.names(prob_purchase) = c("Low Price ","High Price ")
kable(prob_purchase, caption = "Probability of Purchase", align = 'c')
```


We have `r T` days until takeoff. We also have `r M_first` seats in first class and `r M_coach` seats in first class. This is shown in the diagram below. 

```{r graph, echo=FALSE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
options(knitr.table.format = "html")
first = matrix(0, M_first/2,4)
first[,1] = ''
first[,4] = ''

coach = matrix(0,M_coach/4,4)

row_num = c(1:35)
class = c(rep("First",M_first/2),rep("Coach",M_coach/4))
seats = rbind(first,coach)
colnames(seats) = c('A','B','C','D')
seats = data.frame(cbind(row_num, seats, class))


seats %>% 
  kbl(format="html", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(2:5,border_left = T, border_right = T) %>%
  row_spec(1:(M_first/2), bold = T, color = "grey", background = "lightblue") %>%
  row_spec(((M_first/2)+1):((M_first/2)+(M_coach/4)), bold = T, color = "grey", background = "lightgreen") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

## First Iteration, Overselling by 5 Seats

We first defined a function to calculate the expected terminal cost given the number of oversold tickets and the number of passengers showing up. 

```{r calc_terminal_cost, include=TRUE}
# Initialize sequences
t_coach_Values = seq(0,T_coach) # all possible number of coach tickets left
t_first_Values = seq(0,T_first) # all possible number of first class tickets left
tValues = seq(0,T) # all possible days until takeoff

t_coach_N=length(t_coach_Values) # count possible coach state values
t_first_N=length(t_first_Values) # count possible first class state values
tN=length(tValues)

V=array(0,c(t_coach_N,t_first_N,tN)) # initialize value function 3d array


V[,,tN]=0
# calculating the terminal expected value (cost)
for(seats.left.first in 0:T_first){
  for(seats.left.coach in 0:T_coach){
    this.cost = 0
    for(show.up.first in 0:(T_first - seats.left.first)){
      for(show.up.coach in 0:(T_coach - seats.left.coach)){
        prob_first = dbinom(show.up.first,T_first - seats.left.first,p_show_first)
        prob_coach = dbinom(show.up.coach,T_coach - seats.left.coach,p_show_coach)
        
        overbooked_coach = max(0,show.up.coach - M_coach)
        extra_seats_in_first = M_first - show.up.first
        coach_to_first = min(overbooked_coach, extra_seats_in_first)
        coach_off_plane = max(0,overbooked_coach - coach_to_first)
    
        cost = c_1*coach_to_first + c_2*coach_off_plane
        
        this.cost = this.cost + prob_coach*prob_first*cost
      }
    }
    V[seats.left.coach+1,seats.left.first+1,tN] = -1*this.cost
  }
}
```

We then created a dynamic program to make the optimal pricing decisions for selling coach and first class tickets with a coach tickets count of `r T_coach` seats.

```{r iteration_1, include=TRUE}

U_coach = V # initialize optimal choice variable for coach

U_coach[,,tN] = 0 # 0 is the value for no tickets for sale
U_first[,,tN] = 0 # 0 is the value for no tickets for sale

The expected discounted profit of selling these tickets and paying out overbooking costs over the course of the year is `r usd(V[t_coach_N,t_first_N,1])`. This includes the expected terminal cost of `r usd(V[1,1,tN])`.

## Overselling by 5-15 seats

We ran the loop of the dynamic program for each of these numbers of seats.

The expected discounted profit of selling these tickets and paying out overbooking costs over the course of the year is `r usd(profit.vec[length(profit.vec)])`.

### How often is coach overbooked?
With the option to sell zero coach tickets under the new strategy, coach is overbooked more often than in the first strategy. In strategy 1, coach is overbooked on average by about 9 seats (total 109), and in strategy 2, coach is overbooked on average by about 20 seats (total 120). The graph below titled "Overbookings" displays the distribution of overbooked seats between both strategies.

### Average overbooking cost
The average overbooking cost of this new strategy is 4,571, which is higher than the average overbooking cost of the original strategy of 950. The graph below titled "Cost" shows the distribution of overbooking costs between both strategies. Although the cost is higher for strategy 2, the profits are also higher, which implies less people get "kicked off" with this strategy. 

### Volatility of discounted profits
The average profit of strategy 2 is 40,839 with a standard deviation of 703. Strategy 1 has an average profit of 42,387 with a standard deviation of 637. Strategy 2 is thus more volatile, which is also evident in the wider spread in the graph below titled "Profits".

It is important to note that the optimal strategy has switched from solving backwards to solving forwards. After solving forward in the last code block, the ideal strategy appears to be strategy 1. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report to boss:

If we do have the option to overbook the plane by 5 seats, the optimal number of seats to sell would be 105 in coach and 20 in first. This would result in an expected discounted profit of $42,242.86.
If we have the option to overbook by a greater amount, the optimal number of seats to sell would be 109, which gives us an expected discounted profit of $42,496.11. As you can see in the “End_Profits” graph, the profits increase sharply after selling 105 seats up to 109, and then the profits begin to decrease because the cost of overbooking begins to exceed the marginal revenue. 
However, if we allow ourselves to sell 0 coach tickets on any given day, this increases our profit more to $44,971.97 by selling 120 coach seats and 20 first class seats.  
When we loop forward, the average profit for strategy 1 is now higher than strategy 2 at 42,387 compared to 40,839. 

We would recommend strategy 2 with the option of selling 0 coach tickets. Although when we looped forward it appears that strategy 1 gives better results, the random simulation that occurs each day leaves much of the results up to chance. For instance, each day there is a 65% chance of a 300 dollar ticket being bought. 
By implementing strategy 2, we expect to overbook more seats and reap higher profits. This can be attributed to the value of the flexibility now existent in our day-to-day selling processes. More flexibility is a great benefit when balancing between demand at the point of sale and the day of the flight.
